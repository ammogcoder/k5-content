we are happy
it is dark
dog is hungry
they are coming
I am a boy
I live in Trichy
please come in line
we are watching tv
they are playing cricket
I am reading poems
what is your name
where are they going
where is your house
we have holiday tomorrow
I am drinking water
I am going to chennai
I am sitting in sofa
Siva is sleeping in bed
the cat is drinking milk
I am thinking of icecream
sun rises in the east
I am playing with my friends
I have not done my homework
I saw a very beautiful puppy
Ravi is very good in math
english is not my favorite subject
